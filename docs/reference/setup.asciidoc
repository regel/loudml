[[tf-version]]
== TensorFlow Version

Loud ML is built and tested with a TensorFlow version {tensorflow_version}. This dependency is pinned via the `requirements.txt` file in the source code.
 
The standard version provided by Google is embedded in the `loudml-base` package and is automatically installed in a vendor/ directory for DEB and RPM builds.

Using an unsupported TensorFlow version will cause issues. Contact us if you need another TensorFlow version.
