[[cli-train]]
== Training Model Command

The `train-model` command will run <<glossary-training,training>> using
the bucket and settings defined both in the model and the command line.
The `from` and `to` parameters support <<date-math>> format
and operations.

[source,bash]
--------------------------------------------------
loudml -e "train-model --from now-30d --to now avg_temp2"
--------------------------------------------------

Training will print logs to `stdout` on the server and report the final model loss.

[NOTE]
==================================================

The training operation requires a long history to achieve a
good loss value. The more data points, the longer training will be.

==================================================

[WARNING]
==================================================

The training API provides revision control. Past training operations
are saved and new versions (checkpoints) are created automatically.
Previous versions can be loaded and restored at any time.
