=== Number of threads

Loud ML uses a number of thread pools for different types of operations. The
actual number of threads will default to the local processor count and can
be changed via the `config.yml` file.

The package distributions when run as services under `systemd` will configure
the number of threads for the loudmld process automatically. No
additional configuration is required.
