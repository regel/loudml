[[rpm-copr]]
==== Enable COPR repository

You have two options to do that:

<1> If youâ€™re using a version of Linux with dnf:

[source,sh]
-------------------------
dnf copr enable regel/loudml
-------------------------

You need to have dnf-plugins-core installed.

<2> Or if you have older distribution:

[source,sh]
-------------------------
yum copr enable regel/loudml
-------------------------

You need to have yum-plugin-copr installed.

[[rpm-repo]]
==== Installing from the RPM repository

ifeval::["{release-state}"=="unreleased"]

Version {version} of Loud ML has not yet been released.

endif::[]

ifeval::["{release-state}"!="unreleased"]

Create a file called `loudml.repo` in the `/etc/yum.repos.d/` directory
for RedHat based distributions, or in the `/etc/zypp/repos.d/` directory for
OpenSuSE based distributions, containing:

ifeval::["{release-state}"=="released"]

["source","sh",subs="attributes,callouts"]
--------------------------------------------------
[copr:copr.fedorainfracloud.org:regel:loudml]
name=Copr repo for loudml owned by regel. Packages for Enterprise Linux 7 - $basearch
baseurl=https://download.copr.fedorainfracloud.org/results/regel/loudml/epel-7-$basearch/
type=rpm-md
skip_if_unavailable=True
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://download.copr.fedorainfracloud.org/results/regel/loudml/pubkey.gpg
repo_gpgcheck=0

--------------------------------------------------

endif::[]

And your repository is ready for use. You can now install Loud ML with one of the following commands:

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------------------
sudo yum install loudml<1>
sudo dnf install loudml<2>
sudo zypper install loudml<3>
--------------------------------------------------
<1> Use `yum` on CentOS and older Red Hat based distributions
<2> Use `dnf` on Fedora and other newer Red Hat distributions
<3> Use `zypper` on OpenSUSE based distributions

[[rpm-running-init]]
==== Running Loud ML with SysV `init`

Use the `chkconfig` command to configure Loud ML to start automatically
when the system boots up:

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------------------
sudo chkconfig --add loudmld
--------------------------------------------------

Loud ML can be started and stopped using the `service` command:

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------------
sudo -i service loudmld start
sudo -i service loudmld stop
--------------------------------------------

If Loud ML fails to start for any reason, it will print the reason for
failure to STDOUT. Log files can be found in `/var/log/loudml/`.

[[rpm-configuring]]
==== Configuring Loud ML

include::etc-loudml.asciidoc[]

The RPM also has a system configuration file (`/etc/sysconfig/loudml`),
which allows you to set the following parameters:

include::sysconfig-file.asciidoc[]

NOTE: Distributions that use `systemd` require that system resource limits be
configured via `systemd` rather than via the `/etc/sysconfig/loudml`
file.  See <<systemd>> for more information.
